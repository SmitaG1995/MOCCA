## MOCCA : *MO*mentum *C*alibration in *C*oincidence data *A*nalysis

### Abstract:

The aim of this notebook is to calibrate the raw data obtained from coindence spectroscopy using image processing and linear fits. Momentum calibration is very important for proper data analysis as all the properties of the particles like kinetic energies, angles of fragmentation depend on the momentum. The data analysis in my research group is done using the [ANACONDA MATLAB package](https://github.com/gasfas/ANACONDA_2) developed by former students the group. The current version doesn't have any autocalibration of data, so this project is an attempt to make the calibration as automated as possible for faster data analysis. Fine calibration is still done manually in this notebook as the human brain is the best machine to detect patterns and shapes which is essential for fine adjustments. The project various Python 3 packages like Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit image, matplotlib and ipywidgets.
